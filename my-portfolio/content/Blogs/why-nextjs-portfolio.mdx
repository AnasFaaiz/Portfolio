# Understanding Async/Await

Async/await is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves a little more like synchronous code. This makes it much easier to read and maintain.

## Why Use It?

- **Cleaner Syntax**: It helps you avoid long chains of `.then()` calls, often referred to as "callback hell."
- **Better Readability**: The code is structured in a more linear, top-to-bottom fashion, which is more intuitive to follow.
